  {
    question: "Are lab-grown diamonds real diamonds?",
    answer: "Yes. Lab-grown diamonds are real diamonds with the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as mined diamonds."
  },
  {
    question: "What’s the difference between lab-grown and mined diamonds?",
    answer: "The difference lies in how they are created. Mined diamonds form naturally underground over millions of years, while lab-grown diamonds are created in controlled environments that replicate the same conditions.\n\nIn terms of appearance, durability, and structure, they are identical. Lab-grown diamonds are typically more accessible in price than mined diamonds of the same size and quality, without sacrificing beauty or integrity."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you sell mined diamonds?",
    answer: "No. ORÉA works exclusively with lab-grown diamonds. This is a deliberate choice aligned with our commitment to modern fine jewellery, transparency, and thoughtful sourcing."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the diamond certified?",
    answer: "Our tiny diamond rings are not certified. We supply certification to all lab-grown diamonds with an individual carat weight of 0.50ct and above. Our certified diamonds come with an IGI certification matching the inscription on the girdle of the stone."
  },
  {
    question: "Do your pieces come with a warranty?",
    answer: "Yes. To find out the details of our Warranty Policy, please visit the separate link here:\n\nORÉA jewellery is crafted to high standards, and we stand behind the quality of our workmanship.\n\n• Rings are covered by a lifetime manufacturing warranty.\n• All other fine jewellery pieces (including earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and pendants) are covered by a two-year manufacturing warranty.\n\nThis warranty covers manufacturing faults but does not include general wear and tear, accidental damage, or misuse."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find my ring size?",
    answer: "We recommend contacting us for guidance or visiting a local jeweller for professional sizing to ensure accuracy before ordering."
  },
  {
    question: "Can my ring be resized if it doesn’t fit quite right?",
    answer: "In many cases, yes. Resizing eligibility depends on the design style and metal type. For selected styles, we offer one complimentary resize for engagement and wedding rings, available within three months of your ring’s completion.\n\nIf you believe a resize may be required, please contact us as soon as possible and we’ll advise on the best next steps."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between 9ct and 18ct gold?",
    answer: "The difference between 14ct and 18ct gold is the percentage of pure gold in the alloy - 14ct has 58% and 18ct has 75%.\n\nThis percentage affects the colour, hardness and durability of the piece. Since pure gold is a soft and malleable material other metals have been added to it to increase the material’s durability - making it great fit for everyday fine jewelry."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help keep my purchase a surprise?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We understand many of our pieces are purchased for meaningful moments such as proposals or special gifts.\n\nOur packaging is discreet and does not reveal the contents. If you have specific concerns or requests to help maintain the surprise, feel free to let us know and we’re happy to assist where possible."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you ship worldwide?",
    answer: "Yes. ORÉA offers international shipping, allowing you to shop with us from anywhere in the world.\n\nMost orders are sent with duties and taxes covered. However, some countries do not allow these charges to be prepaid by the sender. In those cases, local import duties or taxes may be payable upon delivery. We recommend checking your local customs regulations or contacting us if you’re unsure."
  },
  {
    question: "Still Have Questions?",
    answer: "If you’re unsure about anything before or after purchasing, we encourage you to get in touch. Fine jewellery is personal, and we believe clarity builds confidence."
